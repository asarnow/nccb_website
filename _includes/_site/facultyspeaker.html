                    is an Assistant Professor of Biomolecular
                    Engineering at UC Santa Cruz whose research group
                    focuses on identifying cancer genome alterations
                    that disrupt gene regulation, particularly through
                    the regulation of RNA splicing. They are
                    developing computational approaches to analyze
                    genome and transcriptome sequencing data and
                    developing high-throughput experimental approaches
                    to characterize the functional impact of cancer
                    variants. Dr. Brooks received her Ph.D. in
                    molecular and cell biology with a designated
                    emphasis in computational and genomic biology at
                    UC Berkeley with Dr. Steven Brenner, then was a
                    postdoctoral fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer
                    Institute and the Broad Institute in the
                    laboratory of Dr. Matthew Meyerson. In recognition
                    of her work, Dr. Brooks was named a Damon Runyon
                    Cancer Research Foundation Merck Fellow and
                    also received the Dale F. Frey Award for
                    Breakthrough Scientists.</p>

                    faculty lecture opening the NCCB conference,
                    Dr. Brooks will discuss her research as well as
                    pass on some knowledge to young scientists.</strong></p>
